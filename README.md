# Mars Data Collection Challenge

## Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
I used Splinter to visit the Mars news site, and the extract the HTML code with Beautiful Soup. Next, I scraped the titles and preview text of the news articles. Lastly, I stored the scraped information in a Python list of dictionaries.

##  Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
I extracted the HTML table in to a Pandas DataFrame. I used that data to answer the following questions:
- How many months exist on Mars?
- How many Martian days' worth of data are there?

I also used the data to answer the following questions by creating visualizations:
- Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?
- Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
- How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year?

After my analysis was complete I exported the DataFrame as a CSV file.
